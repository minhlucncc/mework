# Ship All — the per-change decision matrix

This is the source of truth for how the `ship-all` orchestrator decides what to
do with each ACTIVE OpenSpec change. The orchestrator runs **fully automatically**
— it never asks the user (per change or overall); every decision comes from this
matrix.

## Branch + execution model (applies to every ship mode)

The orchestrator owns branch creation; `ship-code` owns the implementation. For
every change that ships, the orchestrator first runs **branch-prep** — from a clean
`main` it creates (or, on resume, reuses) `feat/<change>`. It then invokes the
nested workflows via the lowercase `workflow()` helper (NOT by spawning an agent
that calls `Workflow()` — workflow-spawned subagents have no `Workflow()` tool):

1. `workflow('ship-plan', { change, date, local: true })` — breaks the change's
   **open tasks** into test+code pairs under `.handoff/<change>/` (gitignored).
2. `workflow('ship-code', { change, date, local: true, base: 'main', bump,
   noPushMain, archive, mergeStrategy, reserveTokens, maxRepairs })` — runs each
   pair **test-first** (Red→Green→one commit), verifies, reviews, then merges
   `feat/<change>` into `main` **locally (no PR)**, syncs delta specs, archives,
   and optionally tags.

There is **no standalone `/opsx:apply`** step — `ship-code` does the implementation
test-first per pair. (A bulk apply would write uncommitted code and trip
`ship-code`'s clean-tree preflight.)

## Per-change decision

For each ACTIVE change, the orchestrator runs `openspec status --change <c> --json`
and `openspec list --json`, then classifies the change by **mode**:

| Mode | Trigger | Steps run by orchestrator |
|---|---|---|
| `apply+ship` | Active, has proposal + design + tasks + specs + `.openspec.yaml`, **0 tasks done** | branch-prep (`feat/<c>` from `main`) → `ship-plan` → `ship-code --local` (ship-code implements every open task test-first, one commit per pair, then merges + archives) |
| `spec+ship` | Active, all artifacts present, **all tasks `[x]`**, no evidence dir | branch-prep → (`workflow('spec-change', { change, maxRevisions: 1 })` when not `--skip-spec`) → `ship-plan` → `ship-code --local` |
| `ship-only` | Active, all tasks `[x]`, evidence dir exists, delta spec already in `openspec/specs/` | branch-prep → `ship-plan` (0 pairs) → `ship-code --local` (verifies existing code, merges, archives) |
| `repair+ship` | Active, **missing `.openspec.yaml`** (scaffolding-only) | 1. `openspec new change <c>` (additive — does NOT touch existing proposal/design/tasks/specs) → 2. promote to `apply+ship` → 3. branch-prep → ship-plan → ship-code |
| `archive-only` | Active, all tasks `[x]`, no `feat/<c>` branch, evidence dir + delta-spec sync complete, no code work expected | 1. `openspec archive <c> -y --skip-specs --no-validate` |
| `skip` | Already ARCHIVED, OR active but no tasks.md (incomplete proposal) | Logged in `.ship-all-progress.json` → `progress.skipped`; never halts the run |

## Cues for the orchestrator agent

1. **Always run `openspec list --json` + per-change `openspec status --change <c> --json` BEFORE deciding modes.** No guessing from the directory listing alone — `cNNNN` filename can be a complete or incomplete proposal.
2. **Sort by cNNNN ordinal** (lexicographic) AFTER expanding `c0014` into `c0014a, c0014b, c0014c`. The numeric ordering respects the dependency graph because each change's proposal was authored in the order the deps required.
3. **Apply `--from <cNNNN>` and `--only <list>` filters** AFTER sorting, so the queue is consistent.
4. **`--dry-run`** runs only Phases 1-2 (Discover + Plan), writes `.ship-all-progress.json`, returns the planned queue. Never commits.
5. **`--skip-spec`** skips the `spec-change` quality pass for `spec+ship` entries (they go straight to `ship-plan` → `ship-code`). Default in batch mode (the 6-critic spec quality pass is too expensive to run for every change in a batch).
6. **Budget reserve**: the orchestrator passes `reserveTokens` to every nested `workflow()` call so a budget hit in ship-code halts the entire run cleanly (not mid-pair).
7. **Nesting**: invoke `ship-plan`/`ship-code`/`spec-change` with the lowercase `workflow()` helper (one level of nesting). Never spawn an `agent()` that tries to call `Workflow()` — those subagents lack the tool.

## Halt semantics

The orchestrator **halts on first failure** and returns:

```json
{
  "stage": "apply+ship" | "spec+ship" | "ship-only" | "repair+ship" | "archive-only",
  "ok": false,
  "change": "c0008-object-storage",
  "reason": "...",
  "mergeSha": "...",          // present if merge already happened
  "archivePath": "...",       // present if archive already moved
  "resumeFrom": "c0009-sessions",  // next change to process on resume
  "progressLog": "openspec/changes/.ship-all-progress.json",
  "nextStep": "Fix the failing change locally, then re-run /opsx:ship-all --from <resumeFrom>"
}
```

**Never** rolls back a merged change. The user must `git reset --hard <pre-merge-sha>` themselves if they want to undo.

## Resume protocol

The `.ship-all-progress.json` is the durable state. On re-run:

1. Read the progress file. For each entry with `status=shipped`, **skip** (it's done).
2. For each entry with `status=pending`, **process** (per mode).
3. For each entry with `status=failed`, **skip with warning** (the user must explicitly clear it via `--retry-failed` or fix the change and re-add).

Use `--from <cNNNN>` to start at a specific ordinal (overrides the resume).

## Output

The orchestrator's final report is a per-change summary table + a single
`.ship-all-progress.json` updated atomically (`fs.writeFileSync` with
`JSON.stringify(progress, null, 2)`) after each change so a halt never loses
state.
