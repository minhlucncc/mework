// surface; they differ only in the Resolver (HTTPDefinitionResolver vs.
// FileDefinitionResolver) and identity (a server-issued grant vs. a
// locally-minted OpSpawn grant + GrantKey). There is no other behavioral
// difference: in both modes the agent runs as a sandbox on the client and the
// session opens on the runner (no server endpoint).

// purely by the Resolver and grant the caller supplies in opts.
