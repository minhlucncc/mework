# Scenario Index

Master catalog of every E2E scenario, its surface, status, and traceability back to the
source OpenSpec scenario and the doc it evaluates. Read a full scenario in its
`NN_*_test.go` file (the Go BDD suite); the World it runs in is [harness.md](harness.md).

- **Status** — `[Impl]` = `[Implemented]` (runnable against today's code);
  `[Pl·cNNNN]` = `[Planned]`, red until that change lands.
- **Spec** — `openspec/specs/<cap>` (baseline) or `openspec/changes/<cNNNN>` (delta).

## Real-world platform surfaces (Go suite, proposed — all skipped)

Added so the suite covers what a production agent hub needs beyond the core. Status
`[Pl·plat]` = proposed platform capability (no openspec change yet).

| ID range | Surface | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| SCHED-01..07 | Scheduling: cron/interval/at, recurring re-arm, pause/resume/cancel, missed-fire policy, timezone, per-tenant list | `15_scheduling_test.go` |
| SESSION-01..07 | Session lifecycle: create→attach→close, list/status/owner, resume-after-reconnect, multiple-per-runner, idle timeout, ownership, tenant isolation | `16_sessions_test.go` |
| CHAT-01..06 | Interactive chat: send→stream, multi-turn history, cancel mid-turn, concurrent isolation, system prompt, backpressure | `17_chat_test.go` |
| STREAM-01..05, STATUS-01..03 | Agent→hub comms: emit progress/log/output, client tails a run, late-subscriber tail, per-run ordering, output→write-back; run status transitions, presence detail, status overview | `18_status_streaming_test.go` |
| CANCEL-01..04 | Cancel running run (graceful→forced), propagate to sandbox, cancel scheduled, idempotent/terminal | `19_cancellation_test.go` |
| QUOTA-01..03, AUDIT-01..03 | Per-tenant concurrent/rate limits, queryable limits; security actions audited, queryable, ordered | `20_quotas_audit_test.go` |
| NOTIFY-01..03, ARTIFACT-01..04 | Completion/failure webhooks + retry; store/retrieve/list artifacts, checksum integrity | `21_notify_artifacts_test.go` |
| SELECT-01..03, SECRET-01..03 | Runner load-balancing, session affinity, no-eligible-runner; grant-scoped secret injection, never-in-argv/logs, scope enforcement | `22_selection_secrets_test.go` |

## Storage & workspaces (Go suite, proposed — all skipped)

Session/run-scoped workspaces backed by S3-compatible storage, with shared-read +
scoped-push and base-code/hooks. Three layers: `ObjectStore` → `WorkspaceManager` →
`WorkspaceFS`.

| ID range | Surface | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| STORE-01..07 | S3-compatible object store: put/get, list-by-prefix, head, delete, presigned GET/PUT, endpoint-agnostic (AWS/MinIO/R2), multipart | `23_workspace_storage_test.go` |
| WS-01..09 | Attach folder→rw mount, sandbox writes a real file, sync-to-remote, detach-flush, force-sync+status, re-attach restores from remote, per-session isolation, write-outside-prefix denied (traversal blocked), agent never holds store creds (presigned) | `23_workspace_storage_test.go` |
| SHARE-01..06 | Read across shared root, shared root read-only, push only the grant-allowed folder, push-outside denied, published folder readable by other sessions, grant scopes read(broad)/write/push(narrow) | `23_workspace_storage_test.go` |
| WSHOOK-01..08 | Base code + lifecycle hooks: init clones a git repo, setup installs deps, pre_run/post_run bracket the agent, failing init aborts the run, hooks run within grant scope, post_sync after remote push, base from archive/store template, hook scripts over stdin not argv | `24_workspace_hooks_test.go` |

## Notes on coverage boundaries

- **Intentionally not covered (removed under the target bus):** the job-queue
  requirements *Exactly-once claim* and *Heartbeat and lease* are REMOVED by c0002 (work
  is pushed over SSE, not claimed). They are covered here only for **today's** baseline
  (JOB-02/03/08) and have no target-architecture counterpart.
- **MODIFIED-in-place requirements** appear under both a baseline scenario and a target
  scenario, matched by title **and** source path: *Two-token authentication*
  (AUTH-01..06 baseline / AUTH-07..08 c0003), *Stateless poll worker* (JOB-04 baseline /
  LOOP-02 c0004), *Safe isolated execution* (today's daemon / SBX-* c0005).
- **c0001-repo-restructure** is a structural/CI change (import-guard, per-component
  build, behavior-preservation). Its scenarios are verified by Go-level arch-lint and
  build tests, not by this system-level E2E suite, so they are intentionally out of
  scope here.
