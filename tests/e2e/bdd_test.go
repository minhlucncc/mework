// Package e2e is the executable BDD scenario catalog for MeWork. Each scenario reads as
// GIVEN/WHEN/THEN and is SKIPPED — the agent-hub target it exercises is not implemented
// yet (openspec/changes/c0001..c0005), and the implemented baseline keeps its own real
// tests elsewhere. These exist so the BEHAVIORS and the proposed API can be reviewed and
// evaluated in real Go before anything is built. See SCENARIOS.md for the index.
//
// Everything here is in _test.go files (package e2e): no production code, nothing wired
// into a binary. `go test ./tests/e2e/...` compiles it and reports every scenario as
// SKIP; `make test` stays green. The proposed API the scenarios drive is sketched in
// api_test.go (the review surface); the harness World is below.
