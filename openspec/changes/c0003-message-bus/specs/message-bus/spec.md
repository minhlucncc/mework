## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Topic-based publish

The server SHALL publish messages to named **topics**. Producers (webhook
ingestion, orchestrator, operators) MUST publish to a topic without knowing which
clients are subscribed, and the set of subscribers MAY change at any time.

#### Scenario: Publish to a topic with subscribers

- **WHEN** a producer publishes a message to topic `runner.<id>.dispatch`
- **THEN** the message is delivered to every client currently subscribed to that topic

#### Scenario: Publish to a topic with no subscribers

- **WHEN** a producer publishes to a topic that has no active subscribers
- **THEN** the publish succeeds and the message is retained for delivery to future subscribers, not dropped as a transport error

### Requirement: SSE subscription contract

Clients SHALL subscribe to one or more topics over a single **Server-Sent Events**
stream (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`). The server MUST push messages as SSE
events as they are published; the client MUST NOT need to poll. Each event MUST
carry a monotonic `id` so the stream is resumable.

#### Scenario: Receive a pushed message

- **WHEN** a client holds an open SSE subscription to topic `T` and a message is published to `T`
- **THEN** the server writes an SSE event to that client's stream without the client issuing a new request

#### Scenario: Subscribe to multiple topics on one stream

- **WHEN** a client opens an SSE subscription requesting topics `A` and `B`
- **THEN** messages from both topics arrive on the same stream, each tagged with its topic

### Requirement: Resumable delivery

The transport SHALL support resumption: when a reconnecting client presents the
last event id it processed (the `Last-Event-ID` header), the server MUST resume
delivery by sending only messages newer than that id that are still within the
backing store's retention window — not from the beginning, and not only from "now".

#### Scenario: Resume after a dropped connection

- **WHEN** a client reconnects with `Last-Event-ID` set to the last event it processed
- **THEN** the server delivers messages newer than that id and does not redeliver already-processed messages

### Requirement: Delivery acknowledgement

A subscribed client SHALL acknowledge terminal handling of a message out-of-band
over POST (not over the SSE stream, which is server→client only). Until a message
is acknowledged or its lease expires, the server MUST be able to redeliver it to
preserve at-least-once handling.

#### Scenario: Ack marks a message handled

- **WHEN** a client finishes handling a delivered message and POSTs an acknowledgement for it
- **THEN** the server marks the message handled and does not redeliver it

#### Scenario: Unacked message is redeliverable

- **WHEN** a delivered message's lease expires without an acknowledgement
- **THEN** the message remains unacknowledged and becomes eligible for redelivery — the server does not mark it handled or drop it

### Requirement: Pluggable broker backend

The server SHALL implement the bus behind a broker-backend interface so the
durability/scale substrate can be swapped **without changing the client-facing SSE
contract**. The default backend is Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`. (Candidate alternative
backends are evaluated in `design.md`, not fixed by this requirement.)

#### Scenario: Swap the backend without breaking clients

- **WHEN** the deployment switches the broker backend to a different implementation of the broker-backend interface
- **THEN** subscribed clients observe no change to the SSE subscription contract or event format

### Requirement: Smart filtered subscription

A subscription SHALL support a filter — exact topics and hierarchical wildcards (e.g.
`session.<id>.*`) — so a subscriber receives only the events it asks for and the broker
need not consider it for non-matching topics.

#### Scenario: Filter delivers only matching events

- **WHEN** a subscriber opens a subscription with the filter `session.s1.*` and the server publishes to both `session.s1.ctrl` and `session.s2.ctrl`
- **THEN** only the `session.s1.ctrl` event is delivered to that subscriber

### Requirement: Lazy delivery

The broker SHALL NOT materialize or buffer non-matching messages for a subscriber. Work
for a subscriber MUST be proportional to the messages on the topics it is entitled to and
filtered for, not to total system traffic.

#### Scenario: Non-matching traffic is not materialized for a subscriber

- **WHEN** a subscriber is filtered to `session.s1.*` and a high volume of `session.s2.*` messages is published
- **THEN** the broker does not enqueue or buffer those non-matching messages for that subscriber

### Requirement: Session control channel and push to sandbox

The bus SHALL provide a per-session control channel (`session.<id>.control`) that the hub
publishes to and that a running sandbox/agent consumes, so the hub can push control
messages (e.g. cancel, input) down to an in-flight run. Control channels MUST be isolated
per session.

#### Scenario: Push a control message to a running sandbox

- **WHEN** the hub publishes a control message to `session.s1.control` while session `s1` has a running sandbox subscribed to it
- **THEN** the running agent receives the control message over its control channel

#### Scenario: Control channels are isolated per session

- **WHEN** a control message is published to `session.s2.control`
- **THEN** a subscriber on `session.s1.control` receives nothing (no cross-session leakage)

### Requirement: Bounded per-subscriber backpressure

The bus SHALL absorb a slow subscriber without blocking publishers or other subscribers,
applying bounded per-subscriber buffering or lease-based redelivery so one slow consumer
does not stall the system.

#### Scenario: A slow subscriber does not stall the bus

- **WHEN** the hub publishes faster than one subscriber drains its stream
- **THEN** publishing is not blocked and other subscribers continue to receive their messages

#### Scenario: Per-topic ordering under concurrent publish

- **WHEN** messages are published concurrently to a single topic
- **THEN** each subscriber receives that topic's messages in per-topic order (best-effort; no global cross-topic ordering is guaranteed)
