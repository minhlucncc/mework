# Offline Agent

## Purpose

Defines the capability to run a self-contained, zero-infrastructure local agent
that operates without a hub server, Postgres, or any network-accessible service.
All state is in-memory or on the local filesystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement: User can start an offline-mode agent bound to a workspace directory

The system SHALL provide a `mework start --workspace <dir> --offline` command
that boots a self-contained local agent process. The agent SHALL resolve its
definition from `<dir>/mework.yml` using a file-system resolver, start the
sandbox (local engine) with AccessTier `observer`, and listen for one-shot task
submissions via the CLI. The command SHALL fail with a clear error when
`--workspace` is missing.

#### Scenario: Start offline agent with valid workspace — observer tier
- **WHEN** user runs `mework start --workspace /tmp/my-workspace --offline`
- **THEN** the agent reads `/tmp/my-workspace/mework.yml` for the agent definition
- **AND** the agent starts the local sandbox with AccessTier `observer`
- **AND** `SandboxCaps().AccessTier` returns `observer`
- **THEN** the agent prints its status and waits for task submissions
- **THEN** the agent stays running until a `mework stop` or SIGINT/SIGTERM

#### Scenario: Observer-tier offline agent scopes working directory

- **WHEN** the offline agent starts with AccessTier `observer`
- **THEN** the sandbox working directory is bound to the workspace directory
- **AND** the sandbox CLAUDE.md includes observer-mode guidance

#### Scenario: Start offline agent without workspace
- **WHEN** user runs `mework start --offline` without `--workspace`
- **THEN** the system prints an error: `--workspace is required in offline mode`
- **THEN** the system exits with a non-zero exit code

#### Scenario: Start offline agent when workspace has no mework.yml
- **WHEN** user runs `mework start --workspace /tmp/empty-dir --offline`
- **THEN** the system prints an error: `no mework.yml found in workspace`
- **THEN** the system exits with a non-zero exit code

### Requirement: User can run a one-shot task against the offline-mode agent

The system SHALL provide a `mework run <instruction>` command that sends a
one-shot task to the running offline-mode agent. The agent SHALL process the
task through its sandbox and stream the result to stdout. The instruction text
SHALL be passed to the agent over stdin (never argv — injection safety
invariant). The command SHALL exit with the agent's exit code when the task
completes.

#### Scenario: Run task when agent is running
- **WHEN** user runs `mework run "list files in the workspace"`
- **THEN** the instruction `list files in the workspace` is delivered to the agent via stdin
- **THEN** the agent processes the instruction through the configured backend
- **THEN** the agent's output is streamed to stdout in real-time
- **THEN** the command exits with code 0 on success

#### Scenario: Run task when no agent is running
- **WHEN** user runs `mework run "hello"` but no offline agent was started
- **THEN** the system prints an error: `no offline agent running — run 'mework start --offline' first`
- **THEN** the system exits with a non-zero exit code

#### Scenario: Run task with empty instruction
- **WHEN** user runs `mework run ""` or `mework run` with no args
- **THEN** the system prints an error: `instruction is required`
- **THEN** the system exits with a non-zero exit code

### Requirement: Agent resolves definition from workspace mework.yml

The offline-mode agent SHALL resolve its definition from `<workspace>/mework.yml`
using a file-system definition resolver (the existing `FileDefinitionResolver`).
The `mework.yml` SHALL specify `name`, `engine`, and `backend` fields. The
agent SHALL use the `engine` field to select the sandbox runtime and the
`backend` field as the subprocess command.

#### Scenario: Resolve valid mework.yml
- **WHEN** workspace contains `mework.yml` with `engine: local` and `backend: claude`
- **THEN** the agent starts a local sandbox that spawns `claude` as the backend subprocess

#### Scenario: Resolve mework.yml with unsupported engine
- **WHEN** workspace contains `mework.yml` with `engine: docker` (not supported in offline mode)
- **THEN** the system prints an error: `offline mode supports only 'local' engine`
- **THEN** the system exits with a non-zero exit code

### Requirement: Offline mode requires zero external infrastructure

The offline-mode agent SHALL NOT depend on Postgres, a hub server, a provider
adapter, or any network-accessible service. All state SHALL be in-memory or on
the local filesystem. The agent SHALL NOT attempt to connect to `MEWORK_HUB_URL`
or register as a runner. No PAT, rt_token, or enrollment is required.

The above describes the **pure-CLI offline variant** (`mework start --offline`
or `mework daemon start --offline` without `--with-mezon`). The
**server-stack offline variant** (`mework daemon start --offline --with-mezon`)
is defined in the `mezon-offline-bundle` capability and DOES spawn a local
`mework-server` and DOES enroll a runner against it; both variants share the
zero-external-infrastructure invariant (no Postgres, no Docker, no remote
services) but only the pure-CLI variant enforces zero-server / zero-enrollment.

#### Scenario: Start agent with no env vars configured
- **WHEN** user runs `mework start --workspace . --offline` with no `MEWORK_HUB_URL` or `DATABASE_URL`
- **THEN** the agent starts successfully without attempting any network connections

#### Scenario: Start agent with network unavailable
- **WHEN** user runs `mework start --workspace . --offline` with no network access
- **THEN** the agent starts and processes tasks without any network-related errors
