# Prebuilt Agent Sandbox Specification

## Purpose

Define a runnable agent as a **prebuilt sandbox definition** — a named, versioned,
immutable artifact binding an engine, an agent backend, an image/config, and resource
limits into a ready-to-run combo — and the execution model for running such a
definition either one-shot by reference or as a long-lived interactive multi-turn
session over a pluggable engine, with live observability and tenant-scoped,
grant-enforced remote control.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Prebuilt sandbox definition

The system SHALL represent a runnable agent as a **prebuilt sandbox definition**: a
named, versioned, **immutable** artifact that binds an **engine**, an **agent
backend**, an **image/config**, and **resource limits** into a ready-to-run combo.
A definition MUST be resolvable by explicit reference (`name@version`) and by a moving
pointer (e.g. `latest`). Republishing an existing version with different content MUST
be rejected rather than silently overwritten. Definitions SHALL be stored as
agent-catalog artifacts (reusing the sandbox bundle metadata), so no new storage
system or schema migration is introduced to add one.

#### Scenario: Publish a prebuilt definition

- **WHEN** an operator publishes definition `local-claude` version `1.0.0` binding engine `local` and backend `claude`
- **THEN** the system stores it as an immutable version retrievable by `local-claude@1.0.0`

#### Scenario: Republishing an existing version is rejected

- **WHEN** an operator publishes `local-claude@1.0.0` and that version already exists with different content
- **THEN** the system rejects the publish rather than overwriting the immutable version

#### Scenario: Resolve a moving pointer

- **WHEN** a client resolves `local-claude@latest`
- **THEN** the system returns the concrete version currently designated latest

### Requirement: Sandbox is the agent runner with a pluggable engine

The system SHALL treat the **sandbox as the agent runner**, where the **engine** is a
property of the sandbox selected by the definition. The `local` engine SHALL be the
default. Each sandbox MUST run **exactly one agent** (one agent per sandbox). Adding a
new engine or a new agent backend MUST NOT require a schema migration.

#### Scenario: Definition selects the engine

- **WHEN** a definition declares engine `docker`
- **THEN** the system materializes the sandbox using the `docker` engine, and a definition declaring `local` uses the `local` engine

#### Scenario: Default engine

- **WHEN** a definition omits an engine
- **THEN** the system uses the `local` engine

#### Scenario: One agent per sandbox

- **WHEN** a sandbox is already running an agent and another agent start is requested for the same sandbox
- **THEN** the system rejects the second start

#### Scenario: New backend without migration

- **WHEN** a definition references a new backend such as `windows-claude` or `v0`
- **THEN** the system runs it without requiring a database migration

### Requirement: Run a prebuilt sandbox by reference

The system SHALL run a prebuilt definition **by reference**: resolve the definition,
start a sandbox via its engine, and run the agent. Prompt and turn content MUST be fed
to the backend over **stdin, never as a command-line argument**.

#### Scenario: Resolve and run

- **WHEN** a caller runs `local-claude@1.0.0` with an instruction
- **THEN** the system resolves the definition, starts a `local` sandbox, and runs `claude` against the instruction

#### Scenario: Content is not placed on the command line

- **WHEN** a run is started with attacker-controllable content
- **THEN** the content is written to the backend's stdin and never appears in argv

#### Scenario: Unknown reference is rejected

- **WHEN** a caller runs a reference that resolves to no definition version
- **THEN** the system rejects the run with a not-found result rather than starting a sandbox

### Requirement: Interactive multi-turn session over a long-lived sandbox

The system SHALL support an **interactive session** in which a single sandbox stays
**alive across multiple turns**. Opening a session from a definition MUST start the
sandbox once; each subsequent turn MUST be delivered to the running agent over stdin;
the session MUST support **cancel/interrupt** of an in-flight turn without destroying
the session; and the session MUST have an explicit lifecycle (create, attach, close)
with **idle reaping**. Sessions MUST be **owned** and **tenant-scoped**.

#### Scenario: Multi-turn over one sandbox

- **WHEN** a user opens a session from `local-claude@1.0.0` and sends two turns
- **THEN** both turns are handled by the same long-lived sandbox process, the second after the first

#### Scenario: Cancel an in-flight turn

- **WHEN** a user cancels while a turn is running
- **THEN** the in-flight turn is interrupted and the session remains open for further turns

#### Scenario: Idle session is reaped

- **WHEN** a session has been idle past its idle timeout
- **THEN** the system closes the session and destroys its sandbox

#### Scenario: Ownership is enforced

- **WHEN** a caller who is not the session owner attempts to attach to or send a turn into the session
- **THEN** the system denies the request

### Requirement: Live logs and observability

The system SHALL stream **live events** from a session/run — at least
`token`, `message`, `done`, and `error` — to subscribers, with exactly one terminal
event (`done` or `error`) per turn. A subscriber that attaches late MUST receive a
**tail of recent events then the live stream** (tail-then-live). Session **status**
and a tenant-scoped **list** of sessions MUST be queryable.

#### Scenario: Live token stream

- **WHEN** a subscriber is attached while a turn runs
- **THEN** it receives `token`/`message` events and one terminal `done` (or `error`) for that turn

#### Scenario: Late subscriber gets tail-then-live

- **WHEN** a subscriber attaches after a turn has already started
- **THEN** it receives recent buffered events and then continues with the live stream

#### Scenario: Query status and list

- **WHEN** an operator queries a session's status and lists sessions for the tenant
- **THEN** the system returns the session's current status and only that tenant's sessions

### Requirement: Pre-baked image for container engines

For **container engines** (e.g. `docker`), a definition SHALL pin a **pre-baked
image** that already contains the agent CLI, so the engine performs **no install step**
at run time. Engines without an image concept (e.g. `local`) MUST ignore the image
field.

#### Scenario: Container engine uses the pinned image

- **WHEN** a `docker` definition pins image `mework/claude:1.0.0`
- **THEN** the sandbox runs that image and installs nothing at run time

#### Scenario: Local engine ignores image

- **WHEN** a `local` definition is run
- **THEN** the system runs the host backend and ignores any image field

### Requirement: Remote-control authorization

All session operations (create, attach, send turn, cancel, close, list) SHALL be
authorized: **tenant-isolated**, bound to the session **owner**, and **grant-enforced**
per the `auth-and-secrets` permission model. A caller lacking the required grant or
crossing a tenant boundary MUST be denied. For listing, the tenant scope MUST be
derived from the authenticated caller, never from a caller-supplied argument.

#### Scenario: Cross-tenant access denied

- **WHEN** a caller in tenant `A` attempts to operate on a session in tenant `B`
- **THEN** the system denies the operation

#### Scenario: List is scoped to the caller's own tenant

- **WHEN** a caller lists sessions
- **THEN** the system returns only the authenticated caller's tenant's sessions, regardless of any tenant argument the caller supplies

#### Scenario: Operation without grant denied

- **WHEN** a caller attempts a session operation for which it has no permission grant
- **THEN** the system denies the operation
